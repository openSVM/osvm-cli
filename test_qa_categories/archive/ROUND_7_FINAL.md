## Round 7 Checks Performed

### ✅ 1. Cross-Reference Validation
All Table of Contents links point to valid headers. No broken anchors.

### ✅ 2. String Literal Consistency
- 488 double-quoted strings
- 1 single-quoted string (acceptable)
Consistent quoting style throughout.

### ✅ 3. Development Markers
Zero TODO, FIXME, XXX, or HACK comments. Specification is complete.

### ✅ 4. Code Block Balance
- Base spec: 119 balanced code blocks
- Agent spec: 34 balanced code blocks
All properly opened and closed.

### ✅ 5. EBNF Grammar Validity
Grammar contains all core non-terminals:
- `program =`
- `statement =`
- `expression =`
- `loop_every =`
- `constants =`
- `helper_def =`

### ✅ 6. No Placeholder Values
Zero TBD, PLACEHOLDER, or incomplete sections.

### ✅ 7. Example Numbering
Examples numbered sequentially: 1, 2, 3, 4. Correct.

### ✅ 8. Version Consistency
Both files show: v1.1 (Current)

### ✅ 9. Available Tools Sections
All 4 examples have "Available Tools:" sections.

### ✅ 10. Tool Naming Convention
Fully documented with rationale and examples.
