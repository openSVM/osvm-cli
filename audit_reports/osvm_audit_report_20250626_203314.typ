= Security Findings

== OSVM-001 - Example security finding

*Severity:* Medium
*Category:* Security
*CWE ID:* CWE-200
*CVSS Score:* 5

*Description:*
This is an example security finding for demonstration purposes

*Impact:*
Potential information disclosure

*Recommendation:*
Review and implement proper access controls

*Code Location:* src/example.rs

*References:*
- https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/200.html

== OSVM-SOL-001 - Missing signer validation in Solana program

*Severity:* Critical
*Category:* Solana Security
*CWE ID:* CWE-862
*CVSS Score:* 9

*Description:*
Detected potential missing signer validation in program instruction handling

*Impact:*
Unauthorized users could execute privileged operations

*Recommendation:*
Always validate that required accounts are signers using is_signer checks

*Code Location:* src/solana/program.rs

*References:*

== OSVM-SOL-002 - Potential PDA verification bypass

*Severity:* High
*Category:* Solana Security
*CWE ID:* CWE-345
*CVSS Score:* 8

*Description:*
Program uses PDA operations without proper verification of derived addresses

*Impact:*
Attackers could provide arbitrary accounts instead of valid PDAs

*Recommendation:*
Always verify PDA derivation matches expected seeds and program ID

*Code Location:* src/solana/pda.rs

*References:*
- https://solanacookbook.com/references/programs.html#how-to-create-a-pda

== OSVM-SOL-003 - SPL token operations without authority checks

*Severity:* High
*Category:* Solana Security
*CWE ID:* CWE-862
*CVSS Score:* 8

*Description:*
Token operations performed without proper authority validation

*Impact:*
Unauthorized token operations could lead to fund theft

*Recommendation:*
Always verify token authorities before performing operations

*Code Location:* src/solana/token.rs

*References:*
- https://spl.solana.com/token

== OSVM-SOL-004 - Missing MEV protection in trading operations

*Severity:* Medium
*Category:* Solana Security
*CWE ID:* CWE-841
*CVSS Score:* 4.5

*Description:*
Trading operations lack protection against MEV attacks

*Impact:*
Transactions vulnerable to front-running and sandwich attacks

*Recommendation:*
Implement slippage protection and transaction deadlines

*Code Location:* src/solana/dex.rs

*References:*
- https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/transactions

== OSVM-SOL-005 - Insecure Solana RPC endpoint usage

*Severity:* Medium
*Category:* Solana Security
*CWE ID:* CWE-319
*CVSS Score:* 5

*Description:*
Application uses public or insecure RPC endpoints

*Impact:*

*Code Location:* src/config/rpc.rs

*References:*
- https://docs.solana.com/cluster/rpc-endpoints

= Security Recommendations

1. Implement regular security audits

2. Keep dependencies up to date

3. Follow security best practices

4. Implement proper Solana account validation

5. Use secure RPC endpoints and MEV protection

6. Follow Solana security guidelines and best practices

= Compliance Notes

- This audit follows industry security standards
- Findings are categorized using CWE framework
- Solana-specific security checks included
- Critical Solana vulnerabilities require immediate attention

= Conclusion

This security audit provides a comprehensive assessment of the OSVM CLI application's security posture. All identified findings should be addressed according to their severity level, with critical and high-severity issues taking priority. Regular security assessments and continuous monitoring are recommended to maintain a strong security stance.
