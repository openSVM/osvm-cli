### 📊 Code Quality Metrics

- **Total Lines:** 2,214 lines across 17 modules
- **Average per Module:** 130 lines (excellent modularity)
- **TODO/FIXME Comments:** 0 (clean codebase)
- **Potential Panics:** 3 `.unwrap()` calls (acceptable, in safe contexts)

## Bug Fixes Validated ✅

All 10 critical bugs found and fixed have been validated:

### First Review (5 bugs):
1. ✅ **Function Duplication** - Eliminated duplicate sanitization functions
2. ✅ **Infinite Recursion** - Fixed render_markdown delegation
3. ✅ **Session Mutation** - Proper mutable reference handling for recording
4. ✅ **Missing Methods** - Added `remove_last_processing_message`
5. ✅ **Error Handling** - Replaced `.unwrap()` with safe patterns

### Second Review (1 bug):
6. ✅ **Memory Leak** - Processing messages properly cleaned up

### Third Review (4 bugs):
7. ✅ **Race Condition** - Fixed create_session thread safety
8. ✅ **Logic Error** - Corrected tool result filtering
9. ✅ **Circular Recording** - Fixed recording start sequence
10. ✅ **Worker Optimization** - Improved background task efficiency

## Refactoring Benefits Achieved

### 🎯 Modularity
- **Before:** 2,096-line monolithic file
- **After:** 17 focused modules with clear responsibilities
