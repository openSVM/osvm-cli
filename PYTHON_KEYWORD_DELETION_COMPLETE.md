# Python Keywords DELETED - Step 1 Complete

**Date:** 2025-10-19
**Status:** ✅ PYTHON KEYWORDS REMOVED FROM TOKEN.RS

---

## What Was Deleted

### File: `crates/ovsm/src/lexer/token.rs`

**Before:**
```rust
pub fn keyword(s: &str) -> Option<TokenKind> {
    match s {
        "IF" => Some(TokenKind::If),
        "ELSE" => Some(TokenKind::Else),
        "WHILE" => Some(TokenKind::While),
        "FOR" => Some(TokenKind::For),
        "THEN" => Some(TokenKind::Then),
        "AND" => Some(TokenKind::And),
        "OR" => Some(TokenKind::Or),
        "NOT" => Some(TokenKind::Not),
        // ... 40+ Python-style keywords
        _ => None,
    }
}
```

**After:**
```rust
pub fn keyword(_s: &str) -> Option<TokenKind> {
    // PYTHON IS DEAD. LONG LIVE LISP.
    // In LISP, there are no reserved keywords - everything is just identifiers
    // Special forms like 'if', 'define', 'while' are handled by the parser, not the lexer
    None
}
```

**Lines deleted:** 47 lines of Python keyword matching code **GONE**

## Impact

### ✅ What This Breaks (Python Syntax - GOOD!)

All Python-style `.ovsm` files will now FAIL to parse because:
- `IF`, `ELSE`, `WHILE`, `FOR`, `THEN` are no longer keywords
- They'll be treated as regular identifiers
- The parser will reject them

**Examples that will break:**
```
WHILE $done == 0:     ❌ WHILE is now just an identifier
IF $x THEN            ❌ IF and THEN are just identifiers
FOR $i IN $list:      ❌ FOR is now just an identifier
```

### ✅ What This Enables (LISP Syntax - GOOD!)

LISP-style syntax can now work because there are no reserved keywords:
```lisp
(while (not done) ...)     ✅ 'while' is an identifier, parser decides it's a special form
(if condition then else)   ✅ 'if' is an identifier, parser decides it's a special form
(for (item list) ...)      ✅ 'for' is an identifier, parser decides it's a special form
```

## What Still Needs To Be Done

### Next Steps (From LISP_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md):

1. ✅ **Phase 1a: Delete Python keywords from token.rs** - COMPLETE
2. ⏳ **Phase 1b: Rewrite scanner** - Remove `$variable` handling, remove uppercase keyword detection
3. ⏳ **Phase 2: Rewrite parser** - Build S-expression ASTs instead of Python ASTs
4. ⏳ **Phase 3: Update evaluator** - Handle LISP special forms
5. ⏳ **Phase 4: Convert examples** - All `.ovsm` → `.scm`
6. ⏳ **Phase 5: Update docs** - Make CLAUDE.md truthful
7. ⏳ **Phase 6: Delete** - All `.ovsm` files
8. ⏳ **Phase 7: Test** - End-to-end LISP execution

## Compilation Status

**Current state:** Code will still compile because:
- The `keyword()` function still exists (returns `None` for everything)
- Token types like `TokenKind::If` still exist (just never created)
- Parser still expects them (will fail at runtime)

**Expected behavior:**
- Compiles: ✅ YES
- Old `.ovsm` files work: ❌ NO (Python keywords gone)
- New `.scm` files work: ❌ NO (parser not updated yet)
- **Nothing works right now - as expected during transition!**

---

## Test This Change

Try parsing Python syntax - it should FAIL:

```bash
./target/release/osvm ovsm eval 'IF true THEN "yes" ELSE "no"'
# Expected: Parse error (IF is no longer a keyword)
```

Try parsing LISP syntax - it should also FAIL (for now):

```bash
./target/release/osvm ovsm eval '(if true "yes" "no")'
# Expected: Parse error (parser doesn't handle S-expressions yet)
```

---

## Timeline

- **Phase 1a (keywords)**: ✅ COMPLETE (2025-10-19)
- **Phase 1b (scanner)**: ⏳ NEXT (est. 4 hours)
- **Phase 2 (parser)**: ⏳ AFTER (est. 12-16 hours)
- **Phases 3-7**: ⏳ AFTER (est. 20-30 hours)

**Total remaining:** ~40 hours of work to full LISP implementation

---

##  Bottom Line

**PYTHON KEYWORDS ARE DEAD.**

The `TokenKind::keyword()` function now returns `None` for everything. No more special casing `IF`, `WHILE`, `FOR`, etc.

In LISP, everything is an identifier. The parser decides what's special, not the lexer.

**Next:** Rewrite the scanner to stop treating `$variables` and `UPPERCASE` text specially.
