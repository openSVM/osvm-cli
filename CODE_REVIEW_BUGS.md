## Critical Bugs

### BUG-001: Toast Thread Spawning Without Layer Name Usage
**File:** `src/utils/agent_chat_v2/ui/toast.rs:186-191`
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Location:** `show_toast()` function

```rust
let layer_name_clone = layer_name.clone();  // Line 185: Created but never used
std::thread::spawn(move || {
    std::thread::sleep(duration);
    cb_sink.send(Box::new(move |s| {
        s.pop_layer();  // Always pops the top layer, which may NOT be our toast!
    })).unwrap_or_default();
});
```

**Problem:**
- `layer_name_clone` is cloned but never used in the closure
- `s.pop_layer()` always removes the **topmost** layer, not necessarily the toast
- If multiple toasts are added rapidly, they get removed in LIFO order, causing unpredictable behavior
- The wrong layer could be removed if user opens a dialog before toast expires

**Impact:** HIGH - Multiple toasts could malfunction; wrong UI elements could be removed

**Suggested Fix:**
```rust
cb_sink.send(Box::new(move |s| {
    // Need to find and remove the specific layer by name
    // Current Cursive API doesn't support this directly
    // Alternative: Keep track of layer names, or use a counter
})).ok();
```

**Workaround:** Use a simpler notification system that doesn't rely on named layers

### BUG-002: Search Filter Cache Inconsistency
**File:** `src/utils/agent_chat_v2/ui/search.rs:119-151`
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Location:** `show_mcp_tool_search()` initialization

```rust
let search_state = Arc::new(RwLock::new(ToolSearchState::new()));

// Load all tools
if let Ok(tools) = state.available_tools.read() {
    if let Ok(mut search) = search_state.write() {
        search.all_tools = tools.clone();
        search.update_filter(""); // Immediate filter on empty query
    }
}

// Results view created OUTSIDE the lock scope - sees potentially stale data
let results_view = create_search_results_view(&search_state);
```

**Problem:**
- `create_search_results_view()` reads `search_state` after the write lock is released
- EditView's `on_edit` callback (line 136) updates search state while results view is being built
- Race condition: Results may not reflect the favorites/recent shown on first load
- Initial filtered_tools may be outdated by the time results_view is created

**Impact:** MEDIUM - Initial search results may be inconsistent or stale on first render

**Proof of Concept:** Open search dialog, tools list shows stale data if edited quickly

---

## High Severity Bugs

### BUG-003: Update Search Results is a No-Op
**File:** `src/utils/agent_chat_v2/ui/search.rs:265-269`
**Severity:** HIGH
**Location:** `update_search_results()` function

```rust
pub fn update_search_results(s: &mut Cursive) {
    // This would need access to the search state stored somewhere
    // For now, we'll just trigger a refresh
    // In a real implementation, we'd store the search state in user data
}
```

**Problem:**
- Function is called but does nothing (line 142: `.on_edit()` calls this)
- User types in search box, but results don't update dynamically
- Search feature is broken - only initial state is shown
- Empty TODO indicates incomplete implementation shipped to production

**Impact:** HIGH - Core search feature is non-functional

**Suggested Fix:**
```rust
fn update_search_results(s: &mut Cursive) {
    // Need to store search_state in user_data of dialog
    // Then update the SelectView by name with new filtered results
}
```

### BUG-004: Unbounded Thread Spawning in Loops
**File:** `src/utils/agent_chat_v2/ui/toast.rs:168-192`
**Severity:** HIGH
**Location:** `show_toast()` called repeatedly

**Problem:**
- Each `show_toast()` call spawns a **new thread** that sleeps for the duration
- If user shows 100 toasts, 100 threads are spawned
- Each thread holds a `cb_sink` clone and waits for duration
- No cleanup of "orphaned" threads if Cursive closes before toast expires
- Thread pool exhaustion possible if toasts shown in tight loop

**Impact:** MEDIUM-HIGH - Resource exhaustion, thread leak

**Suggested Fix:**
- Use a background task manager instead of spawning threads directly
- Or use tokio tasks instead of std::thread
- Implement thread pooling

---

### BUG-005: Panic on Missing AdvancedChatState
**File:** `src/utils/agent_chat_v2/ui/search.rs:113-116, 273-276`
**Severity:** HIGH
**Location:** Multiple locations with `.expect()`

```rust
let state = s
    .user_data::<AdvancedChatState>()
    .cloned()
    .expect("AdvancedChatState should be set");  // Will panic if not set!
```

**Problem:**
- `.expect()` will panic if user data isn't set properly
- No graceful error handling
- UI crash instead of graceful degradation
- Appears in 3+ locations in search.rs

**Impact:** HIGH - Application crash if state initialization fails

**Suggested Fix:**
```rust
let state = match s.user_data::<AdvancedChatState>() {
    Some(state) => state.clone(),
    None => {
        // Show error toast, return early
        return;
    }
};
```

## Medium Severity Bugs

### BUG-006: Session Search Results Not Bound
**File:** `src/utils/agent_chat_v2/ui/search.rs:363-366`
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Location:** `update_session_search_results()`

```rust
if results.is_empty() {
    // Can't add a placeholder to SelectView, so we'll leave it empty
    // In a real app, we might switch to a different view type
}
```

**Problem:**
- When search returns no results, SelectView is left completely empty
- No feedback to user that search had no matches
- Comment indicates incomplete implementation

**Impact:** MEDIUM - Poor UX; user doesn't know if search worked

---

### BUG-007: Favorites Tracking Not Persisted
**File:** `src/utils/agent_chat_v2/ui/search.rs:245-250`
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Location:** `create_search_results_view()` submit handler

```rust
// Add to recent
if let Some(dialog) = s.find_name::<Dialog>("tool_search_dialog") {
    // Store as recent
    if let Some(state) = s.user_data::<AdvancedChatState>() {
        // TODO: Add to search state recent list  // <-- Not implemented!
    }
}
```

**Problem:**
- When user clicks a tool, code attempts to add it to recent tools
- But the `add_recent()` method is never called - just a TODO comment
- Recent tools tracking is broken
- Search state reference is local and not persisted

**Impact:** MEDIUM - Feature doesn't work; user can't track recent tools

---

### BUG-008: Memory Leak in Session Count Calculation
**File:** `src/utils/agent_chat_v2/ui/search.rs:300-304`
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Location:** `show_session_search()`

```rust
for (id, name, _agent_state) in sessions {
    let message_count = if let Some(session) = state.get_session_by_id(id) {
        session.messages.len()
    } else {
        0
    };
    // Session returned by get_session_by_id() is not being dropped properly
```

**Problem:**
- If `get_session_by_id()` returns a reference/clone, it's being held in the display format
- Multiple lock acquisitions in a loop (get_session_names, then get_session_by_id)
- Potential deadlock if state callbacks try to modify during iteration
- Same pattern repeated in `update_session_search_results()`

**Impact:** LOW-MEDIUM - Possible performance issue, not a hard leak

---

## Low Severity Issues

### ISSUE-001: Unused Variable in Message Rendering
**File:** `src/utils/agent_chat_v2/ui/message_rendering.rs:202-206`
**Severity:** LOW
**Location:** Match arm for AgentPlan

```rust
ChatMessage::AgentPlan(plan) => {
    plan_message = format!("{} planned tools", plan.len());
    ("Planning", plan_message.as_str())
},
```

**Problem:**
- The variable `plan_message` is created outside the match expression
- Lifetime issues: `plan_message` must outlive the match expression
- String created with `format!()` then immediately borrowed with `.as_str()`
- This works but is non-idiomatic and fragile

**Impact:** LOW - Code works but is confusing

---

## Summary by Severity

| Severity | Count | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Critical | 2 | Require immediate fix |
| High | 3 | Require timely fix |
| Medium | 2 | Should fix soon |
| Low | 1 | Nice to have |

---

## Recommended Priority Order

1. **Fix BUG-003** (Update search results) - Core feature broken
2. **Fix BUG-001** (Toast layer removal) - Could break other UI
3. **Fix BUG-005** (Panic handling) - Crashes application
4. **Fix BUG-004** (Thread spawning) - Resource exhaustion
5. **Fix BUG-002** (Cache inconsistency) - Race condition
6. **Fix BUG-007** (Recent tools) - Incomplete feature
7. **Fix BUG-006** (Empty results) - UX improvement
8. **Fix ISSUE-001** - Code quality

---

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Rapid toast testing:** Show 10+ toasts in quick succession, verify each removes correctly
2. **Search dialog:** Type quickly while results update, verify no crashes
3. **Session cleanup:** Create/delete sessions while search dialog open
4. **Thread monitoring:** Check for thread leaks during extended use
5. **State consistency:** Restart app, verify favorites/recent persist (when fixed)
