;; Query: Calculate liquidity pool (LP) token value in AMM DEX
;; Category: Advanced - DeFi/Blockchain
;; Expected: 10000 (integer representing token value)
;; Demonstrates: Real-world DeFi calculation, proportion math

;; Automated Market Maker (AMM) Liquidity Pool Mechanics:
;; - Users deposit token pairs (e.g., SOL/USDC) into a pool
;; - In return, they receive LP tokens representing their share
;; - LP token value = (user's share / total supply) * reserve value

;; Pool state
(define reserve-a 1000000)    ;; Pool has 1M tokens of asset A
(define reserve-b 2000000)    ;; Pool has 2M tokens of asset B
(define total-supply 1000)    ;; Total LP tokens minted

;; User position
(define user-balance 10)      ;; User owns 10 LP tokens

;; Calculate user's share of the pool
;; Share = user_balance / total_supply = 10 / 1000 = 0.01 (1%)

(define user-share (/ user-balance total-supply))

;; Calculate value in terms of asset A
;; Value = share * reserve = 0.01 * 1,000,000 = 10,000

(define value-in-a (* user-share reserve-a))

value-in-a  ;; Result: 10000

;; Interpretation:
;; - User owns 1% of the pool (10/1000 LP tokens)
;; - They can redeem for 10,000 of asset A
;; - Or equivalently: 20,000 of asset B
;; - This is the basis for LP token pricing in protocols like Raydium, Orca

;; Real-world use cases:
;; - Calculating impermanent loss
;; - Determining withdrawal amounts
;; - Pricing LP tokens for lending protocols
;; - Portfolio value tracking
