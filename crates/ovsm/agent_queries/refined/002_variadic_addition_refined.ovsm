;; Query: Demonstrate variadic addition by summing numbers 1 through 10
;; Category: Basic - Variadic Operators
;; Expected: 55 (integer)
;; Demonstrates: OVSM operators accept multiple arguments, unlike Python-style

;; OVSM's + operator is variadic - it can take any number of arguments
;; This is more concise than looping or repeated binary operations

(+ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10)  ;; All operands summed in one expression

;; Alternative approaches:
;; - Loop with accumulator (more verbose)
;; - Nested additions: (+ (+ (+ 1 2) 3) ...) (less readable)
;; - Variadic form is idiomatic OVSM

;; Result: 55
