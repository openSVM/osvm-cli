- Clear progression path for users

## Impact

### Before:
- README.md: Basic Quick Start (657 lines total)
- docs/examples.md: Good coverage but missing AI/MCP/OVSM (754 lines)
- No dedicated beginner tutorial
- Limited practical output examples

### After:
- README.md: Comprehensive workflows with outputs (1,068 lines total, +411 lines)
- docs/examples.md: Complete coverage of all features (1,365 lines, +611 lines)
- New Quick Start Guide: Complete beginner path (400 lines)
- **Total new content: 1,400+ lines of practical examples**
