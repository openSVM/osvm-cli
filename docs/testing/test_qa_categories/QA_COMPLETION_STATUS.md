## Key Features Across All Files

### 1. Authentic OVSM Syntax
```ovsm
$variable = getSlot()

TRY:
  $data = riskyOperation()
CATCH RECOVERABLE:
  $data = fallbackSource()

DECISION: Check data quality
  BRANCH A (high quality): Use exact calculation
  BRANCH B (low quality): Use sampling

RETURN {
  result: $finding,
  confidence: 95
}
```

### 2. Real-World Use Cases
- ✅ User-centric questions ("I sent SOL, did it go through?")
- ✅ Security scenarios ("My wallet was drained")
- ✅ Professional analysis ("Detect MEV sandwich attacks")
- ✅ Forensics ("Reconstruct the exploit")

### 3. Comprehensive Tool Usage
- **Solana RPC**: getSlot, getBlock, getTransaction, getSignaturesForAddress, getProgramAccounts
- **Data Processing**: MAP, FILTER, FLATTEN, GROUP_BY, SORT_BY, UNIQUE
- **Statistical**: MEAN, STDDEV, PERCENTILE, DETECT_OUTLIERS, CORRELATE
- **Graph Analysis**: ADD_NODE, ADD_EDGE, FIND_CLUSTERS, FIND_PATH
- **String Operations**: CONTAINS, SPLIT, TRIM
- **Error Handling**: TRY/CATCH/GUARD

### 4. Production-Ready Patterns
- Error handling with graceful degradation
- Rate limiting (SLEEP for RPC calls)
- Pagination (getSignaturesForAddress loops)
- Parallel execution where appropriate
- Confidence scoring
- Caveat documentation

## Usage

### For Developers
```bash
# Test specific category
cd test_qa_categories/01_transaction_analysis
cat 07_forensics.md

# Search for specific scenarios
grep -r "sandwich attack" test_qa_categories/
```

### For AI Training
- Each file can be used as a training example for OVSM language understanding
- Questions represent real user intents
- Expected plans show proper planning structure
- Confidence scores teach uncertainty handling

### For Testing OSVM CLI
```bash
# Feed questions to osvm analyze command
osvm analyze "My transaction failed with custom error 0x1. What went wrong?"

# Should generate plan matching forensics scenarios
```

## Quality Assurance Checklist

For each file, verify:
- [ ] Uses authentic OVSM syntax (no pseudo-code)
- [ ] Questions sound like real user concerns
- [ ] Tool usage matches Standard Library
- [ ] Error handling present
- [ ] Confidence scores included
- [ ] Caveats documented
- [ ] Actionable recommendations provided
- [ ] Time/cost estimates realistic

## Next Steps

1. **Complete remaining categories** with same quality level as enhanced files
2. **Add cross-category scenarios** (e.g., "NFT collection linked to DeFi exploit")
3. **Create integration tests** that execute OVSM plans
4. **Build answer validation** to verify plan correctness
5. **Generate user documentation** from QA scenarios
