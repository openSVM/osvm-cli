# Testing Documentation Update

## Enhanced Testing Coverage for Deployment Commands

This document outlines the expanded automated testing suite for the `osvm deploy` and related deployment commands, as requested in issue #49.

### Test Structure Overview

The testing suite has been significantly enhanced with the following new test categories:

#### 1. Integration Tests (`tests/deployment_integration_tests.rs`)
- **Configuration Validation**: Tests deployment config creation and validation
- **Network Selection**: Tests "all", "mainnet", "testnet", "devnet", and invalid network selections
- **Error Handling**: Tests missing files, invalid inputs, and recovery scenarios  
- **Backward Compatibility**: Ensures CLI interface remains stable
- **GitHub Actions Environment**: Tests environment variable handling for CI/CD
- **Large Binary Handling**: Tests binary size validation and confirmation flows
- **JSON Serialization**: Tests deployment result serialization for CI integration

#### 2. GitHub Actions Workflow Tests (`tests/github_actions_tests.rs`)
- **Workflow Structure**: Validates YAML structure and syntax
- **Input/Output Validation**: Tests workflow inputs, outputs, and secrets configuration
- **Security Practices**: Validates secret handling and permissions
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Tests multi-OS workflow configuration
- **Action References**: Validates action versions and local action paths
- **Environment Variables**: Tests CI environment configuration

#### 3. Performance Tests (`tests/performance_tests.rs`)
- **Execution Time Thresholds**: Validates 10% performance degradation limit
- **Memory Allocation Efficiency**: Tests memory usage patterns
- **RPC Client Cache Performance**: Tests caching optimization
- **JSON Serialization Performance**: Tests at-scale data handling
- **Concurrent Operations**: Tests multi-threaded performance
- **Large File Handling**: Tests performance with various binary sizes

#### 4. Performance Benchmarks (`benches/deployment_benchmarks.rs`)
- **Criterion-based Benchmarks**: Detailed performance profiling
- **File Loading Benchmarks**: Tests program and config loading performance
- **Network Operation Benchmarks**: Tests RPC client efficiency
- **Memory Allocation Benchmarks**: Tests memory usage patterns
- **Serialization Benchmarks**: Tests JSON performance at scale

### Current Test Coverage Status

#### Existing Tests (Already Passing)
- ✅ 16 eBPF deployment tests (core functionality)
- ✅ 80+ unit tests across modules
- ✅ Audit system tests
- ✅ Self-repair system tests
- ✅ Diagnostics tests

#### New Tests Added (All Passing)
- ✅ 13 deployment integration tests
- ✅ 12 GitHub Actions workflow tests  
- ✅ 9 performance threshold tests
- ✅ Full benchmark suite (compilation verified)

### Test Execution

#### Running All Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test

# Run specific test suites
cargo test --test deployment_integration_tests
cargo test --test github_actions_tests
cargo test --test performance_tests
cargo test --test ebpf_deploy_tests

# Run benchmarks
cargo bench
```

#### Running Tests in CI
The existing CI workflow (`ci.yml`) automatically runs all tests on:
- Push to main branch
- Pull requests
- Multiple platforms (Ubuntu, with cross-platform support available)

### Performance Thresholds

The test suite enforces the following performance requirements:

#### File Operations
- Program loading (500KB): < 100ms
- Program ID loading: < 10ms
- Config creation (1000 instances): < 10ms

#### Memory and Caching
- RPC client cache hits: < 1ms
- Memory allocation efficiency: Linear scaling ±20%
- JSON serialization (100 results): < 10ms each

#### Network Operations
- RPC client caching provides >10x speedup
- Concurrent operations scale efficiently
- No more than 10% performance degradation for 2x file size

### Backward Compatibility

The test suite includes specific backward compatibility tests:
- CLI argument compatibility
- Configuration file format compatibility
- Deployment result format consistency
- Boolean IDL flag compatibility

### GitHub Actions Integration

#### Workflow Validation
- Validates `svm-deploy.yml` reusable workflow structure
- Tests input/output definitions and types
- Validates secret handling and security practices
- Ensures proper action versioning

#### Environment Support
- Tests GitHub Actions environment variable detection
- Validates workspace and runner OS handling
- Tests CI/CD integration scenarios

### Mock Testing Strategy

The enhanced test suite uses a balanced approach:
- **Real Integration Tests**: Where feasible for GitHub Actions validation
- **Mocked Network Calls**: For unit testing without external dependencies
- **File System Testing**: Using `tempfile` for isolated test environments
- **Serialization Testing**: Full round-trip validation

### Code Coverage Target

The test suite aims for ≥85% code coverage on deployment-related modules:
- Core deployment logic (`ebpf_deploy.rs`)
- Network selection and validation
- Configuration handling
- Error scenarios and recovery

### Extending the Test Suite

#### Adding New Tests
1. Integration tests: Add to `tests/deployment_integration_tests.rs`
2. Workflow tests: Add to `tests/github_actions_tests.rs`
3. Performance tests: Add to `tests/performance_tests.rs`
4. Benchmarks: Add to `benches/deployment_benchmarks.rs`

#### Testing Guidelines
- Use `tempfile` for test file creation
- Use `serial_test` for tests that modify global state
- Mock external dependencies where appropriate
- Include both success and failure scenarios
- Test edge cases and error conditions

### Continuous Integration

The test suite integrates with existing CI/CD workflows:
- Automatic execution on PR creation/updates
- Performance regression detection
- Cross-platform validation
- Security and workflow validation

This enhanced testing infrastructure ensures deployment commands remain robust, performant, and CI/CD-ready while maintaining backward compatibility.
