## Recommendations for Production Use

### Use Immediately ✅
1. **OVSM Language Specification** - Train AI models, write research plans
2. **System Prompts** - Load into AI agents for OVSM planning
3. **Execution Prompts** - Implement runtime decision making
4. **43 Golden Questions** - Test blockchain analysis tools
5. **Documentation** - Reference for developers

### Use with Caution ⚠️
1. **QA Dataset Templates** - Good for syntax, but verify logic before execution
2. **Auto-generated questions** - Use as structural examples, not production tests

### Don't Use Yet ❌
1. **QA questions with placeholder logic** - Will fail if executed directly
