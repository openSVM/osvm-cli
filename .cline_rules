# OSVM CLI Project Rules

## CRITICAL: No Custom Scripts
- **NEVER create custom shell scripts, Python scripts, or any standalone scripts in this repository**
- **ALL functionality must be implemented within the osvm binary itself**
- **The only way to execute functionality is through the compiled osvm binary**
- If a feature needs to be added, it must be implemented in the Rust source code and compiled into osvm

## Project Structure
- All code must be in Rust source files under src/
- Use cargo build to compile changes
- Execute features only via ./target/debug/osvm or cargo run

## Examples of what NOT to do:
- ❌ Creating shell scripts (*.sh files)
- ❌ Creating Python scripts (*.py files)  
- ❌ Creating any standalone executable scripts
- ❌ Using external tools when osvm can handle it

## Examples of what TO do:
- ✅ Implement features in Rust within src/
- ✅ Use cargo build to compile
- ✅ Run features via osvm binary commands
- ✅ If osvm doesn't have a feature, implement it in the Rust code first
